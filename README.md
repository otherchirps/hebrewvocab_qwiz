# Hebrew Vocabulary qwiz set

An attempt at making a [qwiz.io](http://qwiz.io) q & a set. 

Possible errors (i.e. *likely* errors), as the native speakers of the house are all away, 
and I'm manually entering on an english keyboard.  

Corrections / new words welcome. 

Also, I'm deliberately skipping the nikkud. 
If I'm ever going to read an israeli newspaper, need to get used to doing without those "training wheels".
